I followed the tutorial "How to Create a Voice Recognition System with Python" to create a voice recognition system with python.

Link to the tutorial: https://reintech.io/blog/how-to-create-a-voice-recognition-system-with-python

// install libraries(in the virtual environment if there is one)
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install PyAudio

create a python file

--------
If you get the following error

    in get_pyaudio
        from distutils.version import LooseVersion
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'distutils'

Try to do "pip install setuptools" in cmd while still in the virtual environment

-------

For speech, there are other options
ex:"The Ultimate Guide To Speech Recognition With Python" lists out a other methods, include one that works offline.

if "hello" in text.lower():
    => Make the text all lower case to avoid future issues.

==========
Note, to show items in a folder, use cmd "dir" ("ls" is for Lunix)
To stop the program from running(kill it), use Ctrl + C
============================
create virtual environment(optional, but recommended)
    =>Navigate to the directory where the repository was cloned
            cd path_name
    =>Create a Virtual Environment named venv
            python -m venv venv
    =>Activate the virtual environment (on Windows)
        ðŸŽ€-----------------------ðŸŽ€
            venv\Scripts\activate
        ðŸŽ€-----------------------ðŸŽ€
            should see the (venv) in cmd

    ðŸ¦„to deactivate the virtual environment, just type in
    ðŸŽ€-----------------------ðŸŽ€
        deactivate
        or
        venv\Scripts\deactivate
    ðŸŽ€-----------------------ðŸŽ€

!!! Generally not advisable to share the env folder
=>In project directory, create a file named .gitignore.
        ðŸ¦„On windows, can stay in virtual environment and type
        ------
        echo. > .gitignore
        ------
=>Open the .gitignore file in any text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code) and add the paths or patterns you want to ignore.
        In this case, just add 
        -----
        /venv
        -----
        inside the file (or /whatever_vertual_envirment_name )
        save the file
